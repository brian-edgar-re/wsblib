# WSBLib - How to use

Learn how to create a web server using the `WSBLib` library.

## Understanding the request cycle

First, the entire request cycle is handled by you. You manipulate the data sent by the client, process the request and send the response, all this **using the WSBLib classes**, which facilitate this whole cycle. A **request cycle using WSBLib** looks like this:

1. Receive client data (specifically a raw HTTP message);
2. Process client request;
3. Get the requested route response;
4. Send response to customer.

If you were to create this from scratch, **without using WSBLib**, you'd have to do all of this:

1. Accept client connection;
2. Receive client data (specifically a raw HTTP message);
3. Format HTTP request data;
4. Check which route was called;
5. Check if the HTTP method is accepted by the route;
6. Generate error responses if the route is not found or the method is not accepted
7. Get the requested route response;
8. Format HTTP response data;
9. Send response to customer.
